Here I try to publish and keep up-to-date projects that I think might be useful to other people.

I also have other repositories on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/beni.trainor.96).
I created them back when GitHub's UI was not as responsive and lacked private
repositories. I continue to use it for personal projects.
